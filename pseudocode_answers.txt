Why do programmers use pseudocode?
it makes it easier for a programmer to visualize what kind of code is intended to write

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
nothing as it is not a language

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
COMPARE first and second numbers
PRINT greater number

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INPUT a variable to 0
Create a FOR LOOP where the variable is less than or equal to 100
PRINT the variable
ADD 1 to the variable
END FOR LOOP

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
INPUT entry name
Create FOR LOOP where IF entry name is equal to any entry
RETURN entry
ELSE return 'not found'
END FOR LOOP


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var entry = '';

for (i=0, i < phonebook.length; i++) {
    if (phonebook[i] === entry) {
        return phonebook[i]
    } else {
        return 'Not Found'
    }
}
